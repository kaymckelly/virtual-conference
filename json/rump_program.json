After we found out how to really control 5G networks, we realised that apart from spreading disease, we could use them to give humanity a better understanding of the arcane UC model, which our archeologists found among the ruins of Springer's archives. We believe this understanding might be the very thing needed to save Earth, so we've travelled through time and space to deliver you this slide deck explaining how to fly a TARDIS with CRAFT.\"\r\n\r\nThe slide deck in the transmission was very hard to understand, but I managed to extract its contents and create an alternative presentation, introducing the following results:\r\n\r\nWe introduce an abstract composable time model that can be used for reasoning about Time And Relative Delay in Simulation (TARDIS), also capturing for the first time Time Lock Puzzles in the UC framework and showing that a programmable random oracle is necessary for realizing them. We motivate this model by building on it to introduce CRAFT: Composable Randomness and Almost Fair computation from Timing based primitives, where we extend our TARDIS treatment to Verifiable Delay Functions and publicly verifiable time lock puzzles, which can be used for building efficient UC-secure randomness beacons MPC with output independent abort (the next best thing when fairness is impossible).",

                  "abstract": "Blockchains are gaining traction and acceptance, not just for cryptocurrencies but increasingly as a general-purpose architecture for distributed computing. In this work we seek solutions that allow a blockchain to act as a trusted long-term repository of secret information: Our goal is to deposit a secret with the blockchain and specify how to use it (e.g., the conditions under which it is released), and have the blockchain keep this information secret and use it only in the requested manner (e.g., only release it once the conditions are met). This simple functionality would be an enabler for many powerful applications, including signing statements on behalf of the blockchain, using blockchain as the control plane for a storage system,  performing decentralized program-obfuscation-as-a-service, and many more.\r\n\r\nWe present a scalable solution for implementing this functionality on a public proof-of-stake blockchain, in the presence of a mobile adversary controlling a small minority of the stake, using proactive secret sharing techniques. The main challenge is that, on the one hand, scalability requires that we use small committees to represent the entire stake, but, on the other hand, a mobile adversary may be able to corrupt the entire committee if it is small. For this reason, prior proactive secret sharing solutions are either non-scalable or insecure in our setting.\r\n\r\nWe solve this issue using ``player replaceability'', where the committee is anonymous until after it performs its actions, as in the Algorand blockchain. (Algorand uses player replaceability to defend against DDoS attacks.) Our main technical contribution is a system that allows sharing and re-sharing of secrets among the members of small dynamic committees, without knowing who they are until after they perform their actions. Our solution handles a fully mobile adversary corrupting less than 25\\% of the stake at any time, and is scalable in terms of both the number of parties on the blockchain and the number of time intervals.",

                  "abstract": "Byzantine Broadcast (BB) is a central question in distributed systems, and an important challenge is to understand its round complexity. Under the  honest majority setting, it is long known that there exist randomized protocols that can achieve BB in expected constant rounds, regardless of the number of nodes $n$. However, whether we can match the expected constant round complexity in the corrupt majority setting --- or more precisely, when $f \\geq n/2 + \\omega(1)$ --- remains unknown, where $f$ denotes the number of corrupt nodes. \r\n\r\nWe are the first to resolve this long-standing question. We show how to achieve BB in expected $O((n/(n-f))^2)$ rounds. In particular, even when 99\\% of the nodes are corrupt we can achieve expected constant rounds. Our results hold under both a static adversary and a weakly adaptive adversary who cannot perform ``after-the-fact removal'' of messages already sent by a node before it becomes corrupt.",
